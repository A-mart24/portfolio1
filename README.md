# portfolio1


MY TASK:

For this weeks homework I was tasked with creating a mock portfolio to show potential employers projects I have created. This homework demonstartes a number of concepts i have learned in regards to HTML and CSS.

USER STORY: AS AN employer I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
